# Child scenario: Inherits base and overrides specific variables
# Demonstrates variable override and inline vars merging

extends: "14-base-with-variables.yml"

# Override department inline (merges with vars_file)
vars:
  department: "Finance"
  bucket_name: "finance-data"

# All tests inherited from base, but now test Finance department access
# The parent tests are automatically re-run with new variable values
