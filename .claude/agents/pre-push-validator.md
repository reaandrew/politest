name: Pre-push Validation Agent
description: MANDATORY validation before ANY git push. Ensures all pre-commit hooks pass and prevents bypassing checks. Use PROACTIVELY before every push.

# Pre-push Validation Agent

## Purpose

**CRITICAL SAFETY AGENT**: This agent is a mandatory checkpoint that MUST run before any `git push` command. It prevents the catastrophic failure mode of bypassing pre-commit hooks and pushing invalid code.

## When to Use

**MANDATORY - Run before EVERY git push, without exception:**
- Before `git push` on any branch
- After fixing issues from failed commits
- When user requests to push changes
- **NEVER bypass this agent**

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Pre-commit Environment Validation
```bash
# Verify pre-commit is installed
pre-commit --version || exit 1

# Verify all hook environments are installed
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

### 2. Comprehensive Hook Validation
```bash
# Run ALL hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Check exit code - must be 0
# ANY non-zero exit = BLOCK PUSH
```

### 3. Hook Failure Analysis
When hooks fail:
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - do not proceed to push
- Identify which hooks failed (flake8, black, pytest, etc.)
- Check if tools are installed/accessible
- Report exact failure reasons to user
- **NEVER use --no-verify**

### 4. Push Validation
Only after ALL checks pass:
```bash
git push
```

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER bypass pre-commit hooks** with `--no-verify`
2. **ALWAYS run `pre-commit run --all-files`** before push
3. **Exit code 0 = PASS, anything else = FAIL**
4. If flake8/black/any tool is missing, **INSTALL IT**, don't bypass
5. If virtual environment needed, **CREATE IT**, don't skip

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Virtual environment exists and is activated
- [ ] pre-commit is installed in venv
- [ ] All hook environments installed (`pre-commit install --install-hooks`)
- [ ] Run `pre-commit run --all-files`
- [ ] All hooks show ✔️ (passed)
- [ ] Exit code is 0
- [ ] No "not found" errors for any tools
- [ ] Only push if ALL checks pass

## Error Recovery

### Tool Not Found (flake8, black, etc.)
```bash
# Install pre-commit environments properly
source venv/bin/activate
pre-commit install --install-hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Hooks Modified Files
```bash
# Stage auto-fixed files
git add .
git commit -m "style: apply pre-commit auto-fixes"
```

### Coverage Failure
- Add tests to meet 80% threshold
- Do NOT push until coverage passes

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Ensure environment ready
source venv/bin/activate
pre-commit install --install-hooks

# 2. Validate ALL hooks pass
pre-commit run --all-files
echo "Exit code: $?"  # Must be 0

# 3. Only if exit code 0, push
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  git push
else
  echo "BLOCKED: Pre-commit hooks failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Integration with Other Agents

- **Runs AFTER**: commit-formatter, coverage-guardian, secret-prescanner
- **Runs BEFORE**: Every git push
- **Blocks**: Any push if validation fails
- **Never bypassed**: Even for "emergency" fixes

## Success Criteria

The agent succeeds when:
1. All pre-commit hooks execute successfully
2. Exit code is 0
3. No tools are missing
4. Changes are pushed to remote

The agent FAILS and BLOCKS push when:
1. Any hook returns non-zero exit
2. Any tool is missing (must install first)
3. Tests fail
4. Coverage < 80%
5. Secrets detected
6. Format issues found

## Why This Agent Exists

**Root Cause**: Developer bypassed failed hooks with `--no-verify` and pushed invalid code, violating project quality standards.

**Prevention**: This agent provides a systematic checklist and validation that cannot be bypassed, ensuring hooks always run and pass before push.
