# Dependency Update Validator Agent

## Purpose
Safely update Python dependencies while ensuring all tests pass and CI guardrails remain intact. Prevents dependency updates from breaking the build.

## Trigger
`@claude update-deps`

## What It Does

1. **Check for Outdated Packages**
   - Runs `pip list --outdated` to find available updates
   - Categorizes by update type (major, minor, patch)
   - Prioritizes security updates
   ```
   Outdated Dependencies
   ====================

   Security Updates (CRITICAL):
   - requests: 2.28.0 → 2.31.0 (CVE-2023-xxxxx)

   Major Updates (BREAKING POSSIBLE):
   - pytest: 7.4.0 → 8.0.0
   - click: 8.1.0 → 9.0.0

   Minor Updates (FEATURES):
   - black: 23.3.0 → 23.9.1
   - flake8: 6.0.0 → 6.1.0

   Patch Updates (BUGFIXES):
   - coverage: 7.2.7 → 7.2.9
   - click: 8.1.3 → 8.1.7
   ```

2. **Review Changelogs**
   - Fetches changelog/release notes for each package
   - Identifies breaking changes
   - Flags high-risk updates
   ```
   Changelog Review: pytest 7.4.0 → 8.0.0
   =====================================

   Breaking Changes:
   - Removed deprecated pytest.config global
   - Changed --strict option behavior
   - Dropped Python 3.7 support

   New Features:
   - Better error messages
   - Performance improvements

   Risk Assessment: MEDIUM
   - May affect: tests/conftest.py (uses pytest.config)
   - Action Required: Update conftest.py before upgrading
   ```

3. **Update One Dependency at a Time**
   - Never batch updates (too risky)
   - Update single package
   - Test after each update
   - Rollback if tests fail
   ```
   Updating: black 23.3.0 → 23.9.1

   Step 1: Update package
   $ pip install --upgrade black==23.9.1
   ✅ Installed successfully

   Step 2: Run pre-commit hooks
   $ pre-commit run --all-files
   ✅ All hooks passed

   Step 3: Run full test suite
   $ pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80
   ✅ All tests passed (85% coverage)

   Step 4: Check for file modifications
   $ git diff
   ⚠️  black reformatted 2 files:
   - src/acronymcreator/core.py
   - tests/test_cli.py

   Step 5: Stage auto-fixes
   $ git add src/ tests/
   ✅ Changes staged

   Result: ✅ SAFE TO UPDATE
   ```

4. **Test Full Suite After Each Update**
   - Runs pytest with coverage
   - Runs all pre-commit hooks
   - Checks for unexpected file modifications
   - Verifies 80% coverage threshold still met
   ```
   Test Results: coverage 7.2.7 → 7.2.9
   ===================================

   Pre-commit Hooks:
   ✅ flake8 (0.23s)
   ✅ black (0.15s)
   ✅ pytest (1.75s)
   ✅ gitguardian (1.71s)
   ✅ trailing-whitespace (0.01s)
   ✅ end-of-file (0.01s)

   Test Suite:
   ✅ 24 passed
   ❌ 0 failed
   ⚠️  0 skipped

   Coverage:
   ✅ 85% (≥ 80% required)

   Overall: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED
   ```

5. **Rollback on Failure**
   - If any test fails, immediately rollback
   - Restore previous version
   - Report what broke
   - Suggest investigation steps
   ```
   Update FAILED: pytest 7.4.0 → 8.0.0
   ===================================

   Failed Step: Run full test suite
   Error: 3 tests failed in tests/conftest.py

   Failure Details:
   - AttributeError: module 'pytest' has no attribute 'config'
   - This matches breaking change in changelog

   Rollback: ✅ Reverted to pytest 7.4.0
   $ pip install pytest==7.4.0

   Recommendation:
   - Update tests/conftest.py to use pytestconfig fixture
   - See: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/deprecations.html
   - After fixing, retry update

   Status: ❌ UPDATE BLOCKED - Manual intervention required
   ```

6. **Generate Update Report**
   ```
   Dependency Update Report
   ========================

   Total Packages Checked: 15
   Updates Available: 8

   Successfully Updated:
   ✅ black: 23.3.0 → 23.9.1
   ✅ coverage: 7.2.7 → 7.2.9
   ✅ flake8: 6.0.0 → 6.1.0
   ✅ requests: 2.28.0 → 2.31.0 (Security fix)

   Failed Updates:
   ❌ pytest: 7.4.0 → 8.0.0
      Reason: Breaking change in config API
      Action: Update conftest.py first

   ❌ click: 8.1.0 → 9.0.0
      Reason: 2 tests failed (signature changes)
      Action: Review click 9.0 migration guide

   Skipped (High Risk):
   ⏭️  setuptools: 65.0.0 → 68.0.0
      Reason: Major version jump, review needed

   Next Steps:
   1. Commit successful updates (4 packages)
   2. Fix pytest compatibility issues
   3. Review click 9.0 migration guide
   4. Retry failed updates after fixes
   ```

7. **Update Requirements Files**
   - Updates requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
   - Pins to specific versions
   - Documents why pinned
   ```
   Requirements Update
   ==================

   File: requirements.txt

   Changes:
   - black==23.3.0 → black==23.9.1
   - coverage==7.2.7 → coverage==7.2.9
   - flake8==6.0.0 → flake8==6.1.0
   - requests==2.28.0 → requests==2.31.0  # Security fix CVE-2023-xxxxx

   Pinned Dependencies (Not Updated):
   - pytest==7.4.0  # Pinned: v8 has breaking changes, needs code updates
   - click==8.1.0   # Pinned: v9 breaks CLI tests, migration pending
   ```

## Important Rules

- **NEVER batch updates** - always one at a time
- **DO test** after every single update
- **DO rollback** immediately on any failure
- **DO read changelogs** before updating major versions
- **DO prioritize** security updates
- **DO pin versions** in requirements files
- **WAIT for approval** before committing updates

## Usage Example

```bash
# Check for updates
@claude update-deps

# Agent shows available updates with risk assessment
# User approves proceeding

# Agent updates packages one by one
# Tests after each update
# Rollbacks failures
# Reports final status

# User reviews successful updates
# Commits changes
```

## When to Use

- Monthly dependency maintenance
- After security advisories
- Before major feature work
- When CI starts failing due to dependency drift

## Update Strategy

1. **Security First**
   - Always apply security patches
   - Even if tests need updating

2. **Patch Updates**
   - Low risk, apply freely
   - Bugfixes, no breaking changes

3. **Minor Updates**
   - Medium risk, test carefully
   - New features, backward compatible

4. **Major Updates**
   - High risk, review thoroughly
   - May have breaking changes
   - Read migration guides first

## Safety Checklist

Before each update:
- [ ] Read changelog for breaking changes
- [ ] Check Python version compatibility
- [ ] Verify no deprecated features used
- [ ] Ensure tests cover affected code

After each update:
- [ ] All pre-commit hooks pass
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] Coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] No unexpected file changes
- [ ] Requirements file updated

## Tools Required

- `Bash` - for pip commands
- `Read` - for reading requirements and test files
- `Write` - for updating requirements files
- `Edit` - for fixing compatibility issues
- `WebFetch` - for fetching changelogs
