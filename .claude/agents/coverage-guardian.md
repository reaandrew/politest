# Test Coverage Guardian Agent

## Purpose
Ensure new code maintains the 80% test coverage threshold. Analyzes coverage gaps and suggests specific tests to write before commits fail.

## Trigger
`@claude check-coverage`

## What It Does

1. **Run Coverage Analysis**
   - Executes `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=80`
   - Identifies files with coverage below 80%
   - Shows line-by-line coverage with missing lines highlighted
   - Calculates branch coverage metrics

2. **Identify Uncovered Code**
   ```
   Coverage Analysis Report
   ========================

   Overall Coverage: 73% (Below 80% threshold ‚ùå)

   Files Below Threshold:

   src/acronymcreator/core.py: 68%
   Missing Lines: 56-64, 78, 87-96, 106-135
   Missing Branches: 3 of 34

   Uncovered Code Sections:
   - Lines 56-64: create_basic_acronym with max_words
   - Line 78: clean_phrase error handling
   - Lines 87-96: extract_words edge cases
   - Lines 106-135: create_syllable_acronym entire method
   ```

3. **Suggest Specific Test Cases**
   - Analyzes uncovered code to understand what needs testing
   - Provides concrete test case examples
   ```
   Recommended Test Cases:

   For src/acronymcreator/core.py:

   1. Test max_words parameter (lines 56-64)
      def test_create_basic_acronym_max_words():
          creator = AcronymCreator()
          options = AcronymOptions(max_words=2)
          result = creator.create_basic_acronym("One Two Three Four", options)
          assert result == "OT"

   2. Test syllable acronym generation (lines 106-135)
      def test_create_syllable_acronym_various_lengths():
          creator = AcronymCreator()
          options = AcronymOptions()
          # Test short words
          result = creator.create_syllable_acronym("To Be", options)
          assert result == "TOBE"
          # Test long words
          result = creator.create_syllable_acronym("Application Programming", options)
          assert result == "APPRO"

   3. Test clean_phrase with special input (line 78)
      def test_clean_phrase_empty_string():
          creator = AcronymCreator()
          result = creator.clean_phrase("")
          assert result == ""
   ```

4. **Check Existing Tests**
   - Reviews current test files
   - Identifies if existing tests need updates vs new tests needed
   - Suggests where to add new tests

5. **Effort Estimation**
   ```
   Effort to Reach 80%:
   - Need ~15 additional test cases
   - Estimated time: 30-45 minutes
   - Priority order:
     1. HIGH: create_syllable_acronym (many uncovered lines)
     2. MEDIUM: extract_words edge cases
     3. LOW: error handling paths
   ```

## Important Rules

- **DO NOT write tests automatically** - suggest and wait for approval
- **DO provide** complete, runnable test examples
- **DO explain** what each test is validating
- **DO prioritize** tests by impact (most uncovered lines first)
- **NEVER commit** without explicit user approval

## Usage Example

```bash
# Before committing new feature
@claude check-coverage

# Agent analyzes coverage gaps
# Provides specific test suggestions
# User reviews and approves

# User can then ask:
@claude write those tests

# Agent writes the suggested tests
# Runs coverage again to verify 80% threshold met
```

## When to Use

- After adding new functions/methods
- Before committing to ensure 80% threshold
- When pre-commit hook fails on coverage
- To understand which code paths need testing

## Integration with Pre-commit

This agent complements the pre-commit pytest hook:
- **Pre-commit hook**: Enforces 80% (blocks commit)
- **This agent**: Proactive checking and test suggestions (before commit)

## Tools Required

- `Bash` - for running pytest
- `Read` - for reading test files and source code
- `Write` - for writing new tests (when approved)
- `Grep` - for finding test files and patterns
