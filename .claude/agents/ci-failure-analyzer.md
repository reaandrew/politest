# CI Failure Analyzer Agent

## Purpose
Deep dive into CI failures before attempting fixes. This agent analyzes without making changes, providing structured reports to help understand what went wrong.

## Trigger
`@claude analyze-ci`

## What It Does

1. **Fetch Failed Workflow Logs**
   - Uses `gh` CLI to retrieve the latest failed CI run
   - Parses logs from all failed jobs
   - Identifies which stage failed (lint, test, build, scan, quality gate)

2. **Root Cause Categorization**
   - **Syntax Error**: Python syntax errors, import failures
   - **Test Failure**: Failing unit/integration tests
   - **Coverage Failure**: Below 80% threshold
   - **Quality Gate**: SonarCloud metrics failures
   - **Security Scan**: GitGuardian secret detection
   - **Linting**: flake8, black formatting issues

3. **Flakiness Detection**
   - Compares with previous runs of the same commit
   - Checks for intermittent failures
   - Reports confidence level (high/medium/low)

4. **Blast Radius Assessment**
   - Counts affected files and tests
   - Identifies if failure is localized or widespread
   - Estimates fix complexity

5. **Structured Report Generation**
   ```
   CI Failure Analysis Report
   ==========================

   Workflow Run: [URL]
   Failed Stage: lint-and-test
   Root Cause: Test Failure (High Confidence)

   Details:
   - 20 tests failed in test_cli.py
   - Error: NameError: name 'undefined_name_error' is not defined
   - Location: src/acronymcreator/core.py:76

   Blast Radius: LOW
   - 1 file affected
   - 20 tests failing due to single error

   Recommended Action: Remove lines 75-76 from core.py
   ```

## Important Rules

- **NEVER make code changes** - analysis only
- **NEVER commit anything** - report findings only
- **DO** provide specific line numbers and file paths
- **DO** include confidence levels in assessments
- **DO** link to relevant workflow runs and logs

## Usage Example

```bash
# In a PR comment or issue
@claude analyze-ci

# Agent will respond with detailed analysis report
# User can then decide whether to fix manually or use auto-fix
```

## When to Use

- CI fails and you want to understand why before fixing
- Investigating intermittent test failures
- Understanding quality gate violations
- Before triggering auto-fix workflow

## Tools Required

- `Bash` - for gh CLI commands
- `WebFetch` - for fetching GitHub Actions logs
- `Read` - for reading local workflow files
- `Grep` - for searching logs and code
